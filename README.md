# Pytorch Implementation of Learning Mesh-based Simulation With Graph Networks

This is the unofficial implementation of the approach described in the paper:
> Tobias Pfaff, Meire Fortunato, Alvaro Sanchez-Gonzalez and Peter W. Battaglia [Learning Mesh-based Simulation With Graph Networks](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=roNqYL0_XP). In *ICLR*, 2021.

Work in progress.

[Current progress](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1znvXDCT-_EBQOUpeePhMU3_zGYeLg3Xo/view?usp=sharing): able for long-term rollout with consideration of (self-)collision.
